# Python 

Python is a powerful object-oriented programming language (OOP). It is important to understand the basic concept of OOP to navigate Python with more ease. 

In simple terms, in OOP an object serves as a container. They can contain data, attributes or properties, and methods. Objects are made to interact with one another, in a way that serves the structure for the program we want to execute. When used correctly, this makes programing easier to modify, debug and maintain. Different languages have different ways to declare an object. 

Python is one of the most popular OOP programing languages for Data Science, mostly because it holds a vast number of standard libraries that support many common tasks like searching text with regular expressions, reading and modifying files, etc.

## Basic data types

As we mentioned before, different programming languages have different ways to declare an object. Python for example has a variety of basic data types that it recognizes when you assign them to a variable. For example:

```python
# How do we assign value to the variables?

number_1 = 9 #Integer number
number_2 = 9.8 #Float number

name = 'My name is Mayra' #String variable
grocery_list = ['Item 1', 'Item 2', 23, '2345'] #This is a list of mixed items

#The next one is going to be a dictionary structure
students = {
    'student1': {'age': 20, 'gender': 'male', 'major': 'Computer Science'},
    'student2': {'age': 22, 'gender': 'female', 'major': 'Biology'},
    'student3': {'age': 21, 'gender': 'male', 'major': 'Psychology'},
    'student4': {'age': 23, 'gender': 'non-binary', 'major': 'Engineering'},
    'student5': {'age': 19, 'gender': 'female', 'major': 'Mathematics'}
}

```
