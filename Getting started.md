NOTE: Please complete the whole reading before installing anything, as some parts highlight older practices and do not reflect the current way to install Python.

If you are brand new to the Python programming language, you first need to have it properly installed on your computer. To run a Python program, you will need a Python interpreter. If you try to install Python from the official page python.org, you are essentially just downloading an executable program that operates a Python interpreter and holds a large suite of useful tools and functions that you can utilize in your code. This is known as the Python standard library.

For the example image, the page usually picks up on the operating system of the computer you are using. If you are looking for a different format or a specific release version, you can manually search for it in the Active Python releases.

# What are Python releases?

Python is community-based and open-sourced, meaning it is free to use, and anyone can participate in improving, maintaining and releasing their own libraries. This adds great functionality to the language but also requires the periodic release of newer versions, which helps to add these newer features and fixes previous bugs. All Python versions are formatted as `A.B.C`; the first number is a major release, the second one a minor release, and the third represents patches to fix bugs. For example, as of writing this, the current release of Python is **3.12.1**. One of the most common issues with 

# For Windows:




Installing it lets you go to your terminal and execute a Python script. Assuming that you know how to deploy and work with the terminal (command tool) in your computer, once you have an interpreter installed, you can run a Python code by going to the folder where the py file is stored (from the terminal), and run:

```
python my_script.py
```

Being 'my_script' the name of our dummy code. This will instruct the Python interpreter stored on your computer to read that file. Assuming that the code obeys the grammatical rules of Python and the instructions in the code have to provide an output, this will appear in the terminal window. Again, this is an example of a very simple code. Some codes also require input from the user, and for that, we will need further tools.
