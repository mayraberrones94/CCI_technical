# Functions, classes and libraries

In the previous page about basic data types, we discussed one of Python's capabilities as an object-oriented programming language, and an important aspect of that its the support for classes and multiple inheritances. This can be done by libraries, or code that is grouped into modules, classes and packages. 

We mentioned the use of keywords by Python, and how those keywords have assigned capabilities. Some of these keywords are there in place facilitate a process or a task. In the case of functions, classes and packages, we can build our own programming tasks.
